for the usual details.


*** Installation

See the file INSTALL.


*** Using plwm without installing

PLWM can be run from the distribution tree.  Start it with python
(if you dearchived the distribution in /home/foo):

  python /home/foo/plwm-2.7/examples/examplewm.py


*** Documentation

In doc, you'll want to build and read plwm.info.  (After running make,
you can read the built info-file in an emacs by pressing C-u C-h i and
giving the path to plwm.info.)

A terse description of the example window manager is in
examples/README.examplewm.


*** Using it.

There are a number of example window managers in examples/. Running
the examples will start that window manager. Examing the examples is
the best way to get a feel for how to configure a plwm window manager.

If you want to test window managers, or switch between them, then
utils/wmm.py is a window manager manager. Read the source file for
documentation.
