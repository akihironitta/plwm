             Installation of the Pointless Window Manager

* Requirements

PLWM requires Python 2.0 or newer, which can be downloaded from
http://www.python.org/.  It has been tested with Python 2.0 through 2.6.

It also requires the Python X Library 0.14 or newer, which can be
downloaded from http://python-xlib.sourceforge.net/.


* Configuring

Configuration is done by the Python distutils package as part of the
installation process.


* Building

No building is required, as there's no C code in PLWM. PLCM (the Pointless
Component Manager), on the other hand, does require building. To build it,
simply change to the 'plcm' subdirectory and run:

    make


* Installing

As root, just type:

    python setup.py install
